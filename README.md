# Hi there 👋
## I'm Aymeric BIZOUARN 🇫🇷
Full stack developer at [HERAKLES](https://herakles.com/) ERP in Vannes.

I work on an ERP solution, contributing across the entire stack: frontend, backend, database, automation, and deployment.
With several years' experience in software development, I specialize in continuous integration (CI/CD), SaaS cloud architectures ☁️ and the integration of dataviz tools 📈.

I've had the opportunity to work with a range of technologies - sometimes modern, sometimes more... atypical - which has taught me to adapt quickly to any technical environment.

On the side, I regularly develop personal projects to test new ideas, explore technologies, or simply for the joy of creating.
